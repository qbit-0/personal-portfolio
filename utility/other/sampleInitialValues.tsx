                I started learning programming by myself back in middle school.
                Going into high school and then contininuing into college, I was
                constantly practicing my skills by collaborating with my friends
                in various engineering and programming contests. I built robots,
                made video games, and presented my ideas in front of crowds.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here's a story. In MESA's National Engineering and Design
                Competition, teams competed in regional, state, and national
                competitions, building and pitching various products in
                technical interviews and public demonstrations. We built a
                machine to visually scan and sort stacks of papers. Initially,
                just representing Bolsa Grande High School in the regional
                competition at UC Irvine, we represented UC Irvine in the state
                competition, and California in the National competition. We got
                second place at nationals.

                When I'm not programming, I'm probably gaming. My curernt
                obsession is with fighting games. I like the dedication to learn
                fighting games, and the intensity of a match. I also enjoy
                colony sims like Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld, as well as
                automation sims like Factorio.
